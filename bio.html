               <h3>‚ãÑVisual Artist</h3>
               Athens, Greece - June 2015 - Present
               <p>As a Visual Artist based in Athens, Greece, since June 2015, I have engaged in collaborative artistic projects that explore various themes through multiple media, including drawing, sculpture, silkscreen printing, video art, sound design, and live performance. My early interest in understanding how emotions function in the brain has profoundly influenced my artistic journey. This curiosity led me to apply for the Game Design and Development Master's program at Aalto University, where I aim to delve deeper into these themes through creativity and collaboration with other artists.
                At Aalto, I look forward to utilizing programming, sound design, animation, and other disciplines to create immersive experiences that reflect emotional narratives. The program's multidisciplinary approach will allow me to work alongside diverse creatives while exploring the intersection of art and technology. My goal is to harness these skills to develop engaging game experiences that resonate emotionally with players, fostering a deeper understanding of human emotions through interactive storytelling.</p>

                My classes foster physical strength and flexibility while enhancing emotional awareness and mental clarity. By exploring the relationship between breath, movement, and emotions, I guide students in cultivating mindfulness and connecting with their inner selves. Through meditation techniques rooted in yoga, I help individuals observe their thoughts and feelings, promoting insights into their emotional well-being. My aim is to create a supportive environment for transformative experiences that deepen self-understanding.</p>
