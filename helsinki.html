           <strong>Description:</strong>The exhibition featured works from students of the Sonic Sculpture workshop at Aalto University of Arts, Design and Architecture.
            
            My project for the "Sculptural Instruments & Sound Art Exhibition" at Aalto University in November 2018 showcased a unique blend of art and technology, exploring the auditory experience of metal surfaces.The installation was constructed primarily from metal and wood, utilizing welding techniques to create a robust structure. The choice of wood was integral for the internal mechanism, which facilitated the interaction between the audience and the artwork.
            <br>
           <strong> Key Features of my Project: <br>
            
            Sensors:</strong> These were strategically placed to detect the presence of passersby, triggering the installation to play a melody. This interactivity emphasized the relationship between the viewer and the artwork, inviting spontaneous engagement. <br>
            <strong>Sound Production:</strong> The melody produced was not conventional; it emerged from the act of scratching the metal surface. This element introduced an intriguing contrast between the potentially jarring sound of metal scratching and the unexpected beauty of the resulting melody. <br>
            <strong>Conceptual Exploration:</strong> My project examined themes of discomfort and surprise, as the scratching sound could initially be perceived as bothersome. However, it transformed into a melodic experience, highlighting randomness and experimentation in sound art.
            By combining these materials and methods, my work not only engaged with sensory experiences but also challenged perceptions of beauty in sound.
