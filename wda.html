            <strong>"We Dream Awake", <a href="https://www.romantso.gr/index.php?lang=en">ROMANTSO Creative hub & cultural center</a>, <br> Athens May - June 2018.</strong>
        <br>
<strong>Role/Contribution:</strong> Collaborative Artist - Cocurator <br>
<strong>Description:</strong> We Dream Awake (2018) is a multifaceted project that took place at ROMANTSO HUB, encompassing contemporary art exhibitions, live performances, screenings, and DJ sets. The goal was to create a vibrant cultural experience that deeply engaged the community. My interactive installation “PLANTASIA”, designed in the shape of a greenhouse, invites participants to explore the symbiotic relationship between people and plants. It poses thought-provoking questions: Can you tune into this exchange? Can you hear it? Can you feel it? What messages are the plants conveying? Through real-time data displayed on an Arduino board, the installation bridges the gap between technology and nature, revealing subtle physiological changes in plants via silver electrodes and conductive paste attached to their leaves. <br>
<strong>Process:</strong> Collaborating with a diverse group of artists, I focused on ensuring thematic coherence across various mediums. My contributions included designing promotional materials and constructing the interactive greenhouse installation, which encouraged audience participation and engagement. The installation process was meticulously documented through photographs capturing both the setup and audience interactions. <br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> The project successfully attracted a diverse audience, fostering community engagement and stimulating dialogue around contemporary art. Feedback highlighted the seamless integration of various artistic forms and the innovative approach to exploring the connection between humans and nature.
