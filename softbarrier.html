<strong>Role/Contribution:</strong> Video Artist
Description: As part of DOCUMENTA 14, I exhibited a video art installation titled "Amygdala Highjack," which delved into themes of memory and perception through innovative visual storytelling. The installation presented a flight safety video that metaphorically negotiated the operation of the amygdala—a group of neurons in our brain that influences every aspect of our lives. By comparing the awkwardness of taking off and landing in an airplane to the awakening of the amygdala, the work explored how both experiences evoke feelings of losing control. <br>
<strong>Process:</strong> I developed the concept through extensive research on neuroscience and memory, creating a narrative that intertwined visual elements with immersive soundscapes. This multi-sensory approach enhanced the viewer's experience, allowing them to engage deeply with the themes presented. <br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> The installation garnered significant attention for its thought-provoking content and innovative presentation. Audience feedback highlighted its emotional impact and relevance to contemporary issues, sparking discussions about the relationship between our emotional responses and everyday experiences.
